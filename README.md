## Taxonomy of Camera Motion Primitives

![Demo GIF](./images/3.gif)
Here we demonstrate our taxonomy includes three reference frames (object-, ground-, and camera-centric) and defines key motion types, including translation (e.g., upward), rotation (e.g., roll clockwise), intrinsic changes (e.g., zoom-in), circular motion (e.g., arcing), steadiness (e.g., shaky), and tracking shots (e.g., side-tracking).


## CameraBench

We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset with over 150K binary labels and captions over ~3,000 videos spanning diverse types, genres, POVs, capturing devices, and post-production effects (e.g., nature, films, games, 2D/3D, real/synthetic, GoPro, drone shot, etc.). We showcase example annotations below:

These annotations allow us to evaluate and improve the performance of SfMs and VLMs on a wide range of tasks (video-text retrieval, video captioning, video QA, etc.) that require both geometric and semantic understanding of camera motion. We show example video QA tasks below:

# SfMs vs. VLMs on CameraBench
We highlight the following key findings:

- Recent learning-based SfM/SLAM methods like [MegaSAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04463) and [CuT3R](https://cut3r.github.io/) achieve superior performance across most motion primitives, significantly outperforming classic methods like COLMAP. Nonetheless, SfMs are still far from solving this task. We show failure cases of SfM methods below:
![Demo GIF](./images/5.gif)
-- *Left:* A `lead-tracking` shot where the camera moves backward as the subject walks forward. Due to unchanged subject framing and lack of distinct background textures, MegaSAM fails to detect camera translation and COLMAP crashes.
-- *Right:* A `roll-clockwise` shot in a low-parallax scene where both MegaSAM and COLMAP fail to converge and output random trajectories with nonexistent motion.

- Although generative VLMs (evaluated using [VQAScore](https://linzhiqiu.github.io/papers/vqascore/)) are weaker than SfM/SLAM, they generally outperform discriminative VLMs that use CLIPScore/ITMScore. Furthermore, they are able to capture the **semantic primitives** that depend on scene content, while SfMs struggle to do so. Motivated by this, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to a generative VLM (Qwen2.5-VL) on a separately annotated training set of ~1400 videos. We show that simple SFT on small-scale (yet high-quality) data significantly boosts performance by 1-2x, making it match the SOTA MegaSAM in overall AP.
